# CodeScholar Subgraph Representation

This module of CodeScholar implements the subgraph representation learning component.
Here, a large set of python programs (treated as graphs) are mapped to an embedding space
using a neural model. In this embedding space subgraphs of graphs are forced to be to the lower left of the parent graph.
